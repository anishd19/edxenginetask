Guidelines
1. Sidebar contains an overview of the user's resume
2. Clicking on the sidebar items will result in a view change on the right hand side
3. Clicking on the projects will open up a project on the right hand side
4. A project is made up of multiple 'divs'. The divs that are not active are transparent. As the user scrolls down they become active.
5. Same behavior is observed when "previous and next" are clicked.
6. Additional items: collapsible sidebar and mobile compatibility.
